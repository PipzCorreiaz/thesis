\fancychapter{\ac{ai} for \emph{Sueca}}
\label{chapter:artificial-player}

This section will describe the most relevant implementation details of the artificial player.
After thoroughly analysing state-of-the-art techniques to solve imperfect information games, and considering \emph{Sueca} is, at this moment, computationally unsolved, the chosen approach was \ac{pimc}.
To implement this search technique, there are three key concepts or algorithms that require a full understanding: the Information Set, the PICM Search and the MinMax Algorithm.
Moreover, the encountered drawbacks are also further described, as well as the enhancements implemented to overcome those limitations.
