\fancychapter{EMYS: the \emph{Sueca} player}
\label{chapter:sueca-player}

Revising the purposes of this work, presented in Section~\ref{sec:problem}, the robotic agent that plays \emph{Sueca} has two main tasks: to choose an adequate card to play and to interact socially according to the game state.
The \ac{ai} module, previously described in Chapter~\ref{chapter:artificial-player}, answers clearly to the first goal.
In the same way the current chapter explains how the second goal has been achieved.
%In order to achieve these goals, some state-of-the-art approaches have been reviewed and considered for the implementation in our domain.
%Thus the current chapter aims to carefully describe the decisions that were taken, some limitations imposed by the domain, as well as enhancements that have been made.
It starts with an overview of the whole system and proceeds
%with the implementation of the artificial player and last of all, details
with the development of the social agent and the considerations that were taken into account.
